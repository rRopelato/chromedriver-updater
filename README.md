# ChromeDriver Updater

## What is ChromeDriver Updater?
ChromeDriver Updater is a program that automatically updates ChromeDriver, for use with the Selenium Basic program created by dev [@florentbr](https://github.com/florentbr)
It updates automatically using Python and Selenium, the program generates a log in the Downloads folder in case there is an error.

## Why I made it?

I made it because i use Selenium Basic a lot, and it sucks to keep the ChromeDriver updated.
