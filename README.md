## What is ChromeDriver Updater? ðŸ”„
ChromeDriver Updater is a convenient program designed to automatically update ChromeDriver for seamless integration with the Selenium Basic program, created by dev [@florentbr](https://github.com/florentbr). The updating process is handled automatically using Python and Selenium, with the program generating a log in the Downloads folder in case of errors.

## Why I made it? ðŸ¤”
I developed this tool out of necessity. As a frequent user of Selenium Basic, manually managing ChromeDriver updates became a tedious task that I wanted to automate.

## ðŸŒŸ Releases (Download)

While it's fully functional, I'm constantly tweaking and striving for a polished HUD.
